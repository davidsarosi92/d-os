## What this is

Hobby / teaching i386 OS kernel.  Boots from GRUB → installs its own
GDT / IDT / paging → talks to a 1280×800 framebuffer with an embedded
8×8 bitmap font → IRQ-driven PS/2 keyboard + xHCI USB host with
boot-HID keyboards → ramfs + devfs + procfs mounted at
`/`, `/dev`, `/proc` → preemptive round-robin scheduler with ring-3
syscalls via `int 0x80` → virtio-blk block device exposed as
`/dev/vda` → exFAT mountable as `/mnt` → screen split into multiple
shell panes (Alt-N to focus, `pane split h|v` to split).

## Status (update when a milestone ships)

✅ **M1 – M20 + M18.5 + M20.5 + M18.6 + M19.5 + M22 – M22.7 + M27** shipped
(10/11 polish sub-items; the lone outstanding one is §M20.6.1
SYSCALL/SYSRET).  M22 + M22.1 + M22.2 (2026-07-04): GUI — gfx
surfaces + compositor + WM core + widget toolkit + file manager,
PS/2 mouse (IRQ12), CMOS RTC, `vfs_unlink`, 1280×800 FB; desktop
shells + apps + command shells are REGISTRY-swappable
(`DESKTOP_SHELL()` / `GUI_APP()` / `SHELL_PROVIDER()` linker
sections; `gui.shell` + `shell.provider` config keys; vista + bare
desktops, d-os + rescue shells, apps under `kernel/gui/apps/`,
`launch` command); GUI dev guide in DOCS §4.14.  M22.3: task
manager app, cooperative task_kill/reap (kthread contract) +
cpu_ms, terminal-window close, minimize, Alt-Tab, dirty-rect
composition (`gui stats`).  M22.4 (2026-07-04): compositor
smoothness — cursor-damage race fix (compositor-side bookkeeping),
rect-bounded drag damage, tearing notes; instant Task Manager
(task_set_change_hook + DEAD reaping via vc_task_bound).  M22.5
(2026-07-04): desktop apps — nav keys end-to-end (PS/2 E0 → HID →
widget keycode events), multiline editor widget + kernel clipboard,
Editor app, Tiny-BASIC (`core/basic.c`, BASIC window via
gui_window_create_task, `run <path>` cmd), file manager 2.0 (path
bar, sorting, Ren/Copy/recursive-Del, GUI_APP_ASSOC extension
associations, vfs_rename/vfs_copy/vfs_unlink_recursive),
maximize/restore.  M22.6 (2026-07-04): tear-free presentation —
Bochs-VBE hardware page flip (DISPI VIRT_HEIGHT double buffer +
Y_OFFSET pan; buffer-age-2 dirty∪prev copy; graceful fallback to
single-buffer blit), plus the QEMU display-scaling fix
(zoom-to-fit=off); corrects M22.4's "not fixable" tearing note.
Same session: 1920×1200 desktop (needs `-device VGA,vgamem_mb=32`
for the double buffer + `BUDDY_MAX_ORDER` 10→12 for 9.2 MiB
contiguous surfaces + `-m 256M`), and terminal-window auto-close
when its hosted task dies (flagged at TASK_DEAD → reused close
teardown → also leaves the Task Manager list).  M27 (2026-07-04):
process model — `struct task` gains ppid/exit_code/reap_owned; an
always-on **init** task universally reaps DEAD non-owned tasks
(closes the zombie-leak gap) + re-parents orphans; `task_kill_tree`
takes a subtree down (GUI window close uses it); `task_spawn_detached`
(parent=init) for daemons; ps + /proc/tasks grow PPID, Task Manager
shows a process tree; pid 0 + init reap-guarded.  M22.7-A (2026-07-05):
per-task GUI apps — every WIN_APP window runs on its own `app:<name>`
task (`app_host_main` + `task_spawn_arg`); compositor = surface-
compositor + input router (per-window `aq` queue, host does widget
dispatch + render + tick); host↔compositor teardown dance; apps now
visible/killable in the Task Manager, a slow app no longer freezes the
GUI.  M22.7-B: the desktop shell/taskbar runs on its own `desktop` task
too (full-screen `panelsurf`; compositor composites taskbar strip +
launcher popup on top; input via `pevq`).  **Net: the compositor is now
a pure surface-compositor + input router; windows, apps AND the panel
are each their own task (the M26 Wayland shape, internal API).**
M22.7 refinements (2026-07-05): idle loops halt only when idle (was:
every iteration → cursor lag with menu/taskman open); vista_motion is
chrome-only repaint not full recompose; **app launches moved to the
desktop task → launched apps are children of `desktop`, not the
compositor**; `panelsurf` is a bottom strip not full-screen (~5 MiB
saved); bare shell reserves a hint strip.  Session vs detached GUI
shells: `task_spawn_under(name,entry,ppid)` parents a launched terminal
to the desktop ("New Shell" = session, dies with the desktop) or to
init ("Detached Shell" = outlives the session — nohup/tmux-detach in a
GUI).  GUI session root: `gui_start` spawns `desktop` first, parents
compositor + windows under it (`boot-shell → desktop → {compositor,
apps}`); no auto-started shells — the GUI boots as a bare desktop
(wallpaper + taskbar), user launches from Start.  Damage is now a LIST
of disjoint rects (was a single bounding box) — `compose()` paints +
presents each rect separately, so a Task Manager refresh + a far-away
cursor stay two small blits instead of one huge union (fixed the
cursor stutter: ~630 KB/frame vs ~2.4–5.3 MB).  Plus: a window click
damages only the two affected windows (was a full 9 MB frame), and the
Task Manager repaints only its listview (`gui_window_request_redraw_rect`).
All on both archs.
Highlights so far: VFS + ramfs + exFAT on virtio-blk, devfs +
procfs, preemptive scheduler, multi-pane shell, xHCI USB + HID,
keyboard layouts, HAL cut (`hal_api.h`), **SMP on i386 + x86_64**
with per-CPU runqueue + load balancer + per-CPU preempt_count + task
affinity (`taskset`) + cross-CPU preempt IPI + MSI/MSI-X allocator,
memory at scale (per-zone buddy PMM + slab + per-CPU magazines +
empty-slab caching + x86_64 HIGHMEM via 1 GiB-page identity-map
extension + ACPI SRAT-derived per-CPU NUMA nodes), APs scheduling,
**x86_64 (long mode) — full parity with i386 INCLUDING xHCI USB +
virtio-blk + exFAT**.  `m20_stubs.c` is empty.

🔲 **Next options** (pick one):

- **M21** — aarch64 port.  Third arch, real torture test of HAL
  portability (no port I/O, GIC instead of APIC, EL1/EL0 instead
  of rings).
- **M23** — Audio (AC97 → HDA → I2S).
- **M24** — Network (NIC → IP/UDP/TCP → sockets).
- **§M19.5.1 i386 kmap** — the deferred half of HIGHMEM: real
  kmap-style temp mappings so i386 can manage > 256 MiB of RAM.
- **§M19.5.3 per-NUMA-node PMM zones** — the deferred deeper half
  of SRAT integration; today the parser populates per-CPU node IDs
  but PMM still has a single zone set.
- **§M20.6.1** — SYSCALL/SYSRET instruction path (needs GDT slot
  reorg to satisfy SYSRET's selector arithmetic).

🔲 **PLAN extensions (placeholders, design only):**
- §M23 — Audio subsystem (AC97 → HDA → I2S).
- §M24 — Network stack (virtio-net → IP/UDP/TCP → sockets).
- §M25 — Userland foundation (per-process VMM, ELF loader, fd
  table, unix sockets + fd passing, mmap, mini-libc) — the
  Wayland prerequisites.
- §M26 — Wayland server (wire protocol over M22 compositor +
  M25 substrate; depends on both).
- **Workload-management cluster** (order M27→M30, independent of the
  M23/M24/M25 line):
  - §M27 — ✅ SHIPPED (DOCS §4.15): init + parent/child hierarchy +
    universal reaper + kill-tree + task_spawn_detached + ps/procfs
    PPID + Task Manager tree.
  - §M28 — System log: klog ring buffer + severity levels +
    /proc/kmsg + `dmesg`.
  - §M29 — Services/daemons: `SERVICE()` registry + supervisor
    (autostart + restart policy) — systemd-lite.  The "upward" answer
    to child-death (supervision/wait).
  - §M30 — Task scheduling: cron as the first real service.
  - §M31 — Watchdog: heartbeat-based freeze detection (per-task /
    per-CPU softlockup / hardware) — the other half of "is it hung?".
- **§M32 — Multi-user** (design only): credentials (uid/gid) on tasks,
  `/etc/passwd`-style user DB, login/sessions, VFS file ownership +
  rwx perms, privilege gating, per-user process isolation.  Hard-depends
  on §M25 (real isolation needs per-process address spaces; today's
  ring-0 kthreads share one, so users would be advisory until then).
- **§M-registry** — Windows-style registry PARKED (accidental history;
  /etc + procfs already covers it).

## Hard conventions (do NOT deviate without asking)

1. **Heavy English comments in code.**  Conversation with the user is
   in **Hungarian** — reply in Hungarian.
2. **Drivers self-register** via `MODULE()` (legacy) or `DRIVER()`
   (probe/init/shutdown lifecycle) — never edit `kernel_main` to wire
   a driver in.
3. **Arch portability:** everything x86-specific lives under
   `kernel/hal/x86/`.  Core code (`kernel/core/`, `kernel/mem/`,
   `kernel/fs/`, portable drivers) must NOT do `__asm__`, port I/O,
   reference descriptor tables, or assume page-table layout.  Target
   arches: x86 (now), x86_64, aarch64.
4. **SMP-ready on UP:** lock + per-CPU APIs in place even when no-op
   today.  Don't ship code that would have to be hunted down later
   for a second core.
5. **Stable interfaces from day one.**  Define the final API shape
   even when the first implementation is a stub.  Don't ship "we'll
   wrap it later."
6. **Linux-inspired, not Linux-bound.**  Adopt the patterns that
   solve a concrete problem we have; reject what's accidental
   history (`kobject`, sysfs, RCU until needed, namespaces, cgroups).

## Where to read (on demand, not eagerly)

- **DOCS.md** — current state, per-component reference.  Has a TOC at
  the top — use `Read` with `offset`/`limit` to land in a specific
  section.
- **PLAN.md** — roadmap + design sketches for upcoming milestones.
  Same TOC pattern.
- **README.md** — public-facing intro.
- Source: arch-independent under `kernel/{core,mem,fs,drivers}/`;
  x86 specifics under `kernel/hal/x86/`.

## Build / run

```sh
./scripts/build.sh                    # default ARCH=i386 → build/i386/d-os.iso
./scripts/run_qemu.sh                 # i386 GUI window, NO disk attached

ARCH=x86_64 ./scripts/build.sh        # → build/x86_64/d-os.iso
ARCH=x86_64 ./scripts/run_qemu.sh     # x86_64 in qemu-system-x86_64
```

`make clean` wipes the current ARCH only; `make clean-all` wipes all
builds.  No header dependencies (yet) — after editing a shared
header (e.g., `hal_api.h`, `vmm.h`, `idt.h`), run `make clean
ARCH=<arch>` to force a rebuild.

For block-layer / future-fs testing, the disk image must be attached
manually (the script intentionally doesn't add `-drive`):

```sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=build/test.img bs=1M count=4   # once
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom build/i386/d-os.iso \
    -drive if=virtio,file=build/test.img,format=raw
```

For headless / automated testing (capture serial log):

```sh
qemu-system-i386 -display none -no-reboot \
    -serial file:/tmp/serial.log -monitor stdio \
    -m 256M -cdrom build/i386/d-os.iso \
    -drive if=virtio,file=build/test.img,format=raw
```

NB: a FORMATTED image (e.g. `build/exfat.img`, mkfs.exfat'd in the
Docker container) carries a boot signature — add `-boot d` or SeaBIOS
boots the empty disk instead of the CD and hangs with no serial
output at all.

Block / USB drivers are i386-only today; x86_64 boots without them
(virtio-blk + xhci need a 64-bit DMA-path revisit — M20.5+).

## Session etiquette

- Use **TodoWrite** for any multi-step work (every milestone qualifies).
- When a milestone ships:
  - Add a component section to **DOCS.md** (under `## 4. Components`).
  - Add a change-log entry to DOCS.md (`## 8. Change log`).
  - Flip the PLAN.md status table row to ✅ and condense the design
    section to a one-paragraph "Shipped, see DOCS.md §…" pointer.
- **Boot-test in QEMU** before claiming done.  For most milestones a
  sendkey-driven script + `-serial file:` capture is enough; for the
  framebuffer text path, `pmemsave 0xb8000` + a small Python script
  renders the cells to ASCII.
- **Pitfalls hit during bring-up** go into BOTH the source comment
  (so future readers see why) AND the PLAN.md milestone as a "Lesson
  learned" note (so the design-time intuition is preserved).

## Where things live (when you're modifying)

| Concern                              | File                                  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Boot order, new milestone wiring     | `kernel/core/kernel.c`                |
| Adding a shell command               | `kernel/core/shell.c`                 |
| Adding a new .c to the build         | `Makefile` (C_SRCS or ASM_SRCS)       |
| New linker section                   | `linker.ld`                           |
| New driver class                     | `kernel/includes/<class>.h` + impl    |
| x86 arch primitives                  | `kernel/hal/x86/`                     |

## Memory pointers (cross-project user preferences)

These live under `~/.claude/.../memory/` and are auto-indexed in
MEMORY.md:
- `feedback_dos_style.md` — heavy English comments, Hungarian
  conversation, keep DOCS.md current.
- `project_dos_arch_goals.md` — modular driver registry, multi-arch
  HAL, multi-session shell, PLAN.md is the roadmap.
