## What this is

Hobby / teaching i386 OS kernel.  Boots from GRUB → installs its own
GDT / IDT / paging → talks to a 1024×768 framebuffer with an embedded
8×8 bitmap font → IRQ-driven PS/2 keyboard + xHCI USB host with
boot-HID keyboards → ramfs + devfs + procfs mounted at
`/`, `/dev`, `/proc` → preemptive round-robin scheduler with ring-3
syscalls via `int 0x80` → virtio-blk block device exposed as
`/dev/vda` → exFAT mountable as `/mnt` → screen split into multiple
shell panes (Alt-N to focus, `pane split h|v` to split).

## Status (update when a milestone ships)

✅ **M1 – M18** shipped.  Highlights so far: VFS + ramfs + exFAT on
virtio-blk, devfs + procfs, preemptive scheduler with lock-handoff,
multi-pane shell, xHCI USB + HID, keyboard layouts, HAL cut
(`hal_api.h`), **SMP — APIC + IOAPIC + 8259 disabled, real cmpxchg
spinlocks, per-CPU `current` task, AP boot via INIT+SIPI+SIPI
(verified on `-smp 4`: all 4 cores online), `lscpu` shell command**.

🔲 **Next: §M19** — memory at scale (buddy allocator, slab on top,
2 MiB kernel direct map, zone abstraction).  M18 unlocks per-CPU
slab magazines, so the two milestones reinforce each other.

🔲 **PLAN extensions added (placeholders, design only):**
- §M22 — GUI infrastructure now includes a Wayland-reuse evaluation
  phase (libwayland-server port vs. custom protocol).
- §M23 — Audio subsystem (AC97 → HDA → I2S).
- §M24 — Network stack (virtio-net → IP/UDP/TCP → sockets).

🔲 Remaining: M19 memory at scale, M20 x64, M21 aarch64, M22 GUI,
M23 audio, M24 network.  See PLAN.md "Active backlog" for the
full grid.

## Hard conventions (do NOT deviate without asking)

1. **Heavy English comments in code.**  Conversation with the user is
   in **Hungarian** — reply in Hungarian.
2. **Drivers self-register** via `MODULE()` (legacy) or `DRIVER()`
   (probe/init/shutdown lifecycle) — never edit `kernel_main` to wire
   a driver in.
3. **Arch portability:** everything x86-specific lives under
   `kernel/hal/x86/`.  Core code (`kernel/core/`, `kernel/mem/`,
   `kernel/fs/`, portable drivers) must NOT do `__asm__`, port I/O,
   reference descriptor tables, or assume page-table layout.  Target
   arches: x86 (now), x86_64, aarch64.
4. **SMP-ready on UP:** lock + per-CPU APIs in place even when no-op
   today.  Don't ship code that would have to be hunted down later
   for a second core.
5. **Stable interfaces from day one.**  Define the final API shape
   even when the first implementation is a stub.  Don't ship "we'll
   wrap it later."
6. **Linux-inspired, not Linux-bound.**  Adopt the patterns that
   solve a concrete problem we have; reject what's accidental
   history (`kobject`, sysfs, RCU until needed, namespaces, cgroups).

## Where to read (on demand, not eagerly)

- **DOCS.md** — current state, per-component reference.  Has a TOC at
  the top — use `Read` with `offset`/`limit` to land in a specific
  section.
- **PLAN.md** — roadmap + design sketches for upcoming milestones.
  Same TOC pattern.
- **README.md** — public-facing intro.
- Source: arch-independent under `kernel/{core,mem,fs,drivers}/`;
  x86 specifics under `kernel/hal/x86/`.

## Build / run

```sh
./scripts/build.sh          # docker build + iso → build/d-os.iso
./scripts/run_qemu.sh       # GUI window, NO disk attached
```

For block-layer / future-fs testing, the disk image must be attached
manually (the script intentionally doesn't add `-drive`):

```sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=build/test.img bs=1M count=4   # once
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom build/d-os.iso \
    -drive if=virtio,file=build/test.img,format=raw
```

For headless / automated testing (capture serial log):

```sh
qemu-system-i386 -display none -no-reboot \
    -serial file:/tmp/serial.log -monitor stdio \
    -m 256M -cdrom build/d-os.iso \
    -drive if=virtio,file=build/test.img,format=raw
```

## Session etiquette

- Use **TodoWrite** for any multi-step work (every milestone qualifies).
- When a milestone ships:
  - Add a component section to **DOCS.md** (under `## 4. Components`).
  - Add a change-log entry to DOCS.md (`## 8. Change log`).
  - Flip the PLAN.md status table row to ✅ and condense the design
    section to a one-paragraph "Shipped, see DOCS.md §…" pointer.
- **Boot-test in QEMU** before claiming done.  For most milestones a
  sendkey-driven script + `-serial file:` capture is enough; for the
  framebuffer text path, `pmemsave 0xb8000` + a small Python script
  renders the cells to ASCII.
- **Pitfalls hit during bring-up** go into BOTH the source comment
  (so future readers see why) AND the PLAN.md milestone as a "Lesson
  learned" note (so the design-time intuition is preserved).

## Where things live (when you're modifying)

| Concern                              | File                                  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Boot order, new milestone wiring     | `kernel/core/kernel.c`                |
| Adding a shell command               | `kernel/core/shell.c`                 |
| Adding a new .c to the build         | `Makefile` (C_SRCS or ASM_SRCS)       |
| New linker section                   | `linker.ld`                           |
| New driver class                     | `kernel/includes/<class>.h` + impl    |
| x86 arch primitives                  | `kernel/hal/x86/`                     |

## Memory pointers (cross-project user preferences)

These live under `~/.claude/.../memory/` and are auto-indexed in
MEMORY.md:
- `feedback_dos_style.md` — heavy English comments, Hungarian
  conversation, keep DOCS.md current.
- `project_dos_arch_goals.md` — modular driver registry, multi-arch
  HAL, multi-session shell, PLAN.md is the roadmap.
